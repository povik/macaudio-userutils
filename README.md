# macaudio-userutils

These are some utilities (mostly Python code) to aid in the development of `macaudio` and related Linux kernel drivers for sound support on Apple Silicon machines.

To be clear on the meaning of the name, the utilities are not aimed at *end users*, but they probe the kernel and hardware from within *userspace*.
